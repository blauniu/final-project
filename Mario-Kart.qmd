## Quarto

Quarto enables you to weave together content and executable code into a finished document. To learn more about Quarto see <https://quarto.org>.

## Running Code

When you click the **Render** button a document will be generated that includes both content and the output of embedded code. You can embed code like this:

```{r}
1 + 1
```

You can add options to executable code like this

```{r}
#| echo: false
2 * 2
```

The `echo: false` option disables the printing of code (only output is displayed).

```{r}
#| label: tbl-one
#| tbl-cap: "Mario Kart World Records"
#| output-location: slide
table1 <- tbl_summary(
  rec,
  by = shortcut,
  label = list(
    `track` ~ "Track name",
    `type` ~ "Three lap record",
    `shortcut` ~ "Shortcut or non-shortcut record",
    `player` ~ "Player's name",
    `system_played` ~ "Used system",
    `date` ~ "World record date",
    `time` ~ "Time in seconds",
    `record_duration` ~ "Record duration in days"
  )
)
table1
```

@tbl-one shows a table of record holders by shortcut or not

The median time of World Record holders that used a shortcut was (`r inline_text(table1, variable = "time", column = "Yes")`)

```{r}
#| tbl-two
#| tbl-cap: "Predicting time from track and player
#| output-location: slide
lm(time ~ track + player,
            data = rec)
tbl_regression(
  track_model,
  intercept = TRUE,
  label = list(
    track ~ "Track name",
    player ~ "Player's name"
  )
)
```

```{r}
#| label: fig-one
#| fig-cap: "Time vs Track"
ggplot(rec, aes(track, time)) + geom_point()
```

@fig-one shows a figure of time vs track

```{r}
#Mean time of record holders
stats <- list(n = nrow(rec),
              mean_time = mean(rec$time))
```

There were `r stats$n` record holders with a mean race time of `r stats$mean_time`
